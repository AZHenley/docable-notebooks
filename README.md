# Docable

> Next-Generation Interactive Notebooks

`docable` will create an interactive notebook from a Markdown file. Docable works by translating markdown files into interactive cells, which can be run, edited, and shared.

This results in a literate programming environment for markdown files. Markdown files remain  100% compatiable and render normally on GitHub, etc. If done properly, Docable can allow you to design and build interactive tutorials, interactive education and training materials, and simple infrastructure runbooks.

## Using a Docable Notebook

With docable, your markdown will be translated from this:

`figlet` will translate the given text into an ascii banner. Try it out!

```bash|{type: 'command'}
figlet docable
```

**Into this**:
